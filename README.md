Saloo is a private social network for sharing greeting cards and gifts. Discover a new way to connect with loved ones, share memories, and celebrate holidays and special occasions. Saloo is for anyone, no matter how you prefer to send your greetings because it’s more personal and customizable. 
 
Saloo combines 5 elements to create a unique greeting card experience:
1.     Photography: Choose the “cover” for your card. Saloo has curated the best options for each holiday and special occasion. Users may also search a catalog of thousands of high-quality images to be used in their card.
2.     Photo Collage: Select up to 4 photos from your library (or camera) to include in your greeting card
3.     Message: Write a message to your recipient (emojis encouraged!!)
4.     Song (optional): Know your recipient’s favorite song? Have one in mind for your occasion? Browse Apple Music’s library and a select a song to play when the card is opened by the recipient
5.     Gift Card (optional): Choose from hundreds of vendors and send to the recipient as a sleek e-Gift Card. The gift will be easily accessible via URL by clicking on the card itself in the app.


While other social networking platforms share to your wider community, Saloo focuses on sharing greetings between individuals and small groups of people that you specify for each card. The convenience, privacy, and scope of custom options make for a wonderful greeting card experience. Please join us by sending a loved one a new kind of greeting today and #SaySaloo.
