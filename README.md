Saloo is a private social network for connecting with loved ones, sharing memories, and celebrating special events.


Saloo combines 4 elements to create a unique greeting card experience:

1. Photography: Choose the “cover” for your card. This will be a high quality photograph from Unsplash, the internet’s source for visuals. Saloo has curated the best options for each holiday and special occasion.

2. Photo Collage: Select up to 4 photos from your library or camera to include in your greeting card

3. Message: Write a message to your recipient

4. Song (optional but encouraged): Know your recipient’s favorite song? Have one in mind for your occasion? Connect your Apple Music (SM) subscription with the click of a button and select a song to play when the card is opened. If your recipient doesn't subscribe to Apple Music, we'll default to a preview of the song. Spotify functionality is coming soon!


While other social networking platforms share to your wider community, Saloo focuses on sharing greetings between individuals and small groups of people that you specify for each card. The convenience, privacy, and scope of custom options make for a wonderful greeting card experience. Please #SaySaloo and send a loved one a new kind of greeting today.
